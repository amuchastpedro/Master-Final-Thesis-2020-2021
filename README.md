# Master-Final-Thesis-2020-2021
This repository contains codes for replication of my Master Final Thesis.


(i) Mexican Stock Market Expected Risk
To measure this, I estimate a GARCH using monthly data of IPC (Quotation and Price Index). File X contains the R-code.

(ii) SVAR
I used the VAR Toolbox 3.0 written by Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi (https://sites.google.com/site/ambropo/MatlabCodes, https://github.com/ambropo/VAR-Toolbox)
